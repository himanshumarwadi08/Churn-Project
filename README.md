📊 Customer Churn Analysis (Python + Power BI)
Problem Statement

Telecom and subscription companies face a major challenge:
👉 Identifying which customers are churning (leaving) and understanding the reasons behind it.

Churn = when a customer cancels their subscription or switches to another provider.

Project Overview

This project combines Python for data preprocessing and analysis with Power BI for dashboard design to explore customer churn behavior (without Machine Learning).

Key Highlights

📈 Churn Metrics: 26.58% churn rate, 7032 total customers, avg. monthly charges $64.80

🔍 Churn Breakdown:

Contract type → Month-to-month customers churn the most

Payment method → Electronic check users have the highest churn rate

Tenure vs churn → Higher churn among early-stage and very long-tenure customers

Gender → Minimal impact on churn

🥧 Churn Distribution: Interactive visualization of churned vs retained customers

Tech Stack

Python: Data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)

Power BI: Data visualization, dashboard creation, interactive reporting

Business Relevance

The dashboard enables businesses to pinpoint customer segments at high churn risk, optimize service strategies, and improve retention.
